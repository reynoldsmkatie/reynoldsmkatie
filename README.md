## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am currently a digital (web) producer for Disney Parks & Resorts and work mostly in a CMS (Tridion, Sitecore, WordPress, etc). I also have experience with Scrum / Agile, project management, documentation-writing and marketing. I am teaching myself to code and I try to learn something new every day.

On April 1, 2021, I created [CodeEveryDamnDay.com](https://www.codeeverydamnday.com/) to track my progress learning front-end web development. I have since created several small projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here are the two I'm most proud of:
