## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am currently a digital (web) producer for Disney Parks & Resorts and do most of my work in a CMS. I also have experience with Scrum / Agile, project management and marketing.

On April 1, 2021, I started [CodeEveryDamnDay.com](https://www.codeeverydamnday.com/) to track my progress learning front-end web development. I have since created several small projects and games using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here are the two projects I'm most proud of:
