## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

On April 1, 2021, I created [CodeEveryDamnDay.com](https://www.codeeverydamnday.com/) to track my progress learning front-end web development. I have since created several small projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. [View my full portfolio](https://www.codeeverydamnday.com/portfolio.html).
